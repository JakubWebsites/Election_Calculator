User will be asked to provide information about the number of seats that will be awarded and the number of parties that participated in the elections in that constituency. The user will then be asked to enter the names and the number of votes cast for each party. Finally, the program will ask the user to choose one of the most commonly used systems for converting votes into mandates.

If You have an idea how to improve this project, let me know.
